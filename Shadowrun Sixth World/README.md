**`This is a work in progress.`**

At this point only the PC sheet is functional, NPC sheets are being addressed now.

TO DO
=
**`PC Sheet`** - 
	* Add Armor Social Ratings from Firing Squad pg50
	* Social  / Vehicle repeating delete icon is on the left
	* Ammo only has one input, there should be an input for per reload and max
	* Arms -> Ranged Might need to add a "Gunnery" skill option and when selected change attribute to Logic

**`NPC Sheets`**
	* Fix Qualities
	* Fix Augmentations
	* Fix Gear
	* Fix Skills
	* Fix Weapons
	* Fix Matrix Device / Programs
	* Fix Spells
	* Fix Complex Forms

**`Future Features Wishlist`**
	* Extended Tests Roller?
	* Make current "Modifiers" text parsed and used to apply modifiers directly to sheet attributes.  For example having "Reaction: +1" in the Modifiers box would automatically apply +1 to the reaction attribute, thus affecting all rolls relying on that attribute.  An advanced idea for this is to have checkboxes to indicate if these modifiers are active currently or not.  I can see these being useful in Adept Powers, Augments, Equipment and possibly other areas.
	* Add Autosofts to Vehicles tab
	* Make Magic updated if Essence drops below it
	* Armor Social Ratings (Firing Squad p50)
	* Add Capacity to Armor?
	* Skills (Expertise and Specialization Buttons) colorize them ... maybe 2 light shades of purple one lighter than the other
	* Sheetworker to uncheck speciallization if expertise is checked and vice versa for everywhere those occur (spells, arms)
	* Have changes to primary ranged weapon firing mode update AR values and DV
	* Add spot for augs/bioware grades (Standard/Beta/Delta/etc)
	* Matrix -> Programs (checkboxes to indicate currently loaded)
	* GOD character sheet (track OS score for multiple characters, npcs)
	* Add spot for augs/bioware grades (Standard/Beta/Delta/etc)
	* Skills (Expertise and Specialization Buttons) colorize them ... maybe 2 light shades of purple one lighter than the other
	* Matrix -> Programs (checkboxes to indicate currently loaded)
	* Major/Minor Actions block for PCs, maybe auto-calculated also?
	* Add move-mod to PC sheet and Sprint roller calculations

# Warhammer 4e Character Sheet (Djjus)

This is a fork of https://github.com/vicberg/Roll20-Warhammer-4e-Character-Sheet, which itself is a port of a original WHFRP2e Template.

This Character Sheet has been updated to fix and enhance mostly in the original style. And uploaded to Roll20 for all to use. 
I'm a active WFRP player and I plan to further enhance this sheet at time goes on.

Usage Notes:

- SETTING: Check setting (cog) tab ever time when setting up a new Char sheet, and select correct options for your game
- Wounds: ensure correct Race and Hardy level are chosen. Wounds are subtracted by adding damage, and given back by subtracting it. Will not go our of 0-Max Wounds range.
- Advantage Field applied to Attacks and appropriate Combat Skills (Cool & Dodge for now) automatically.
- For an advanced talent you must select the taken checkbox in order for target to be above 0.
- On Weapons ensure you select the coresponding skill (e.g. Melee Basic, Melee Parrying, Ranged Bow, Ranged Blackpowder etc), and that the correct skill is learned and advance points in it.
- Arcane Spells need to have a number in CN and Damage Field or they will not roll correctly, both fields will default to Zero.
- Extended Channelling Test (spellbook tab, Arcane Spells only), set Accu Ext SL to 0 before beginning a new Channelling action. Increment with Success level of roll until finished. Allows easy tracking of CN v Accu Ext SL for all players. (NPC tab has channelling on all spells for simplicity)
- NPC tab is intended of quick persistent and contained NPC creation without the need for full character sheets for each of them. With template integration, semi featured with conmtained Name / Characteristic / Condition / Advantage ingration and up to 5 weapons & spells for each NPC, and a colapisble notes section. Good for GMs and players. (I would still recommed seperate character sheet for actual bosses). 


Possible additons to come :

- Condition Tracker
- 
- Map/Info Tab (maybe)


Enjoy.

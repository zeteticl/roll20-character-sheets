Note that this does not affect either fuel consumption or damage caused by the fire. The caster can affect any or all fires in the spell’s area. He can alter their intensities with a single gesture as long as the spell is in effect. The spell lasts until the caster cancels it, all fuel is burned, or the duration expires. The caster can also extinguish all flames in the area, which expends the spell immediately. The spell does not affect fire elementals or similar creatures.'

The area of effect can be a portal, a section of floor, stairs, etc. As soon as any creature enters the warded area, touches it, or otherwise contacts it without speaking a password established by the caster, the *alarm* spell lets out a loud ringing that can be heard clearly within a 60-foot radius. (Reduce the radius by 10 feet for each interposing door and by 20 feet for each substantial interposing wall.) The sound lasts for one round and then ceases. Ethereal or astrally projected creatures do not trigger an alarm, but flying or levitating creatures, invisible creatures, or incorporeal or gaseous creatures do. The caster can dismiss the alarm with a single word.'

The spell has no effect on a person already armored or a creature with Armor Class 6 or better. It is not cumulative with the *shield* spell, but it is cumulative with Dexterity and, in case of fighter/mages, with the shield bonus. The *armor* spell does not hinder movement or prevent spellcasting, and adds no weight or encumbrance. It lasts until successfully dispelled or until the wearer sustains cumulative damage totaling greater than 8 points + 1 per level of the caster ([[8+[[@{level-wizard}]] ]] points). (It is important to note that the armor does *not* absorb this damage. The armor merely grants an AC of 6; the wearer still suffers full damage from any successful attacks.) Thus, the wearer might suffer 8 points from an attack, then several minutes later sustain an additional 1 point of damage. Unless the spell were cast by a wizard of 2nd level or higher, it would be dispelled at this time. Until it is dispelled, the *armor* spell grants the wearer full benefits of the Armor Class gained.'

    'effect': 'When the *audible glamer* spell is cast, the wizard causes a volume of sound to arise, at whatever distance he desires (within range), and seem to recede, approach, or remain at a fixed place as desired. The volume of sound created, however, is directly related to the level of the spellcaster. The noise of the *audible glamer* is that of 4 men per level of the caster. Current noise is [[4*[[@{level-wizard}]] ]] men. Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The auditory illusion created by an *audible glamer* spell can be virtually any type of sound, but the relative volume must be commensurate with the level of the wizard casting the spell. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight men running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise volume of 16 men, while a roaring dragon is equal to the noise volume of no fewer than 24 men. \n&emsp;A character stating that he does not believe the sound receives a saving throw, and if it succeeds, the character then hears a faint and obviously false sound, emanating from the caster’s direction.

Any creature in the area of the flames suffers 1d3 points of damage, plus 2 points for each level of experience of the spellcaster, to a maximum of 1d3+20 points of fire damage.

    'effect': 'Cantrips are minor spells studied by wizards during their apprenticeship, regardless of school. The *cantrip* spell is a practice method for the apprentice, teaching him how to tap minute amounts of magical energy. Once cast, the *cantrip* spell enables the caster to create minor magical effects for the duration of the spell. However, these effects are so minor that they have severe limitations. They are completely unable to cause a loss of hit points, cannot affect the concentration of spellcasters, and can only create small, obviously magical materials. Furthermore, materials created by a cantrip are extremely fragile and cannot be used as tools of any sort. Lastly, a cantrip lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects. \n&emsp;Whatever manifestation the cantrip takes, it remains in effect only as long as the wizard concentrates. Wizards typically use cantrips to impress common folk, amuse children, and brighten dreary lives. Common tricks with cantrips include tinklings of ethereal music, brightening faded flowers, glowing balls that float over the caster’s hand, puffs of wind to flicker candles, spicing up aromas and flavors of bland food, and little whirlwinds to sweep dust under rugs. Combined with the *unseen servant* spell, it’s a tool to make housekeeping and entertaining simpler for the wizard.'

The caster cannot duplicate a specific individual. The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form. The duration of the spell is 2d6 rounds plus two additional rounds per level of experience of the spellcaster. The DM may allow a saving throw for disbelief under certain circumstances: for example, if the caster acts in a manner obviously inconsistent with his chosen role. The spell does not alter the perceived tactile (i.e., touch) properties of the caster or his equipment, and the ruse can be discovered in this way.'

    'effect': 'This spell affects any single *person* it is cast upon. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not. \n&emsp;The person receives a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect, with any adjustment due to Wisdom (see Table 5). If the person receives damage from the caster’s group in the same round the *charm* is cast, an additional bonus of +1 per hit point of damage received is added to the victim’s saving throw. \n&emsp;If the spell recipient fails his saving throw, he regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The spell does not enable the caster to control the charmed creature as if it were an automaton, but any word or action of the caster is viewed in the most favorable way. Thus, a charmed person would not obey a suicide command, but he might believe the caster if assured that the only chance to save the caster’s life is for the person to hold back an onrushing red dragon for “just a minute or two.” Note also that the spell does not endow the caster with linguistic capabilities beyond those he normally possesses (i.e., he must speak the victim’s language to communicate his commands). \n&emsp;The duration of the spell is a function of the charmed person’s Intelligence and is tied to the saving throw. The spell may be broken if a successful saving throw is rolled, and this saving throw is checked on a periodic basis, according to the creature’s Intelligence (see the following table). If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed person by some overt action, or if a *dispel magic* spell is successfully cast upon the charmed person, the *charm* spell is broken. \n&emsp;If two or more *charm* effects simultaneously affect a creature, the result is decided by the DM. This could range from one effect being clearly dominant, to the subject being torn by conflicting desires, to new saving throws that could negate both spells. \n&emsp;Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while he was charmed.'

It can be cast only upon a single creature (or a symbiotic or community entity) or upon a single object that does not exceed 10 cubic feet in volume per caster level. The object or creature must be seen to be affected. It grows by up to 10% per level of experience of the wizard ([[10*[[@{level-wizard}]] ]]%), increasing this amount in height, width, and weight. \n&emsp;All equipment worn or carried by a creature is enlarged by the spell. Unwilling victims are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. A successful saving throw means the spell fails. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size, bursting weak enclosures in the process, but it is constrained without harm by stronger materials—the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by growth. \n&emsp;Magical properties are not increased by this spell—a huge *sword +1* is still only +1, a staff-sized wand is still only capable of its normal functions, a giant-sized potion merely requires a greater fluid intake to make its magical effects operate, etc. Weight, mass, and strength are affected, though. Thus, a table blocking a door would be heavier and more effective, a hurled stone would have more mass (and cause more damage), chains would be more massive, doors thicker, a thin line turned to a sizeable, longer rope, and so on. A creature’s hit points, Armor Class, and attack rolls do not change, but damage rolls increase proportionately with size.For example, a fighter at 160% normal size hits with his long sword and rolls a 6 for damage. The adjusted damage roll is 10 (that is, 6 × 1.6 = 9.6, rounded up). Bonuses due to Strength, class, and magic are not altered. \n&emsp;The reverse spell, *reduce*, negates the *enlarge* spell or makes creatures or objects smaller. The creature or object loses 10% of its original size for every level of the caster, to a minimum of 10% of the original size. Thereafter, the size shrinks by 1-foot increments to less than 1 foot, by 1-inch increments to 1 inch, and by 1⁄10-inch increments to a minimum of 1⁄10 of an inch—the recipient cannot dwindle away to nothingness. \n&emsp;For example, a 16-foot-tall giant reduced by a 15th-level wizard (15 steps) would be reduced to 1.6 feet (in nine steps), then to 6⁄10 of a foot or 7.2 inches (in one step), and finally to 2.2 inches (in the last five steps). A shrinking object may damage weaker materials affixed to it, but an object will shrink only as long as the object itself is not damaged. Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. spell.'

    'effect': 'This spell enables the caster to attempt to summon a familiar to act as his aide and companion. Familiars are typically small creatures, such as cats, frogs, ferrets, crows, hawks, snakes, owls, ravens, toads, weasels, or even mice. A creature acting as a familiar can benefit a wizard, conveying its sensory powers to its master, conversing with him, and serving as a guard/scout/spy as well. A wizard can have only one familiar at a time, however, and he has no control over what sort of creature answers the summoning, if any at all come. \n&emsp;The creature is always more intelligent than others of its type (typically by 2 or 3 Intelligence points), and its bond with the wizard confers upon it an exceptionally long life. The wizard receives the heightened senses of his familiar, which grants the wizard a +1 bonus to all surprise die rolls. Normal familiars have 2–4 hit points plus 1 hit point per caster level, and an Armor Class of 7 (due to size, speed, etc.). \n&emsp;The wizard has an empathic link with the familiar and can issue it mental commands at a distance of up to 1 mile. Note that empathic responses from the familiar are generally fairly basic—while able to communicate simple thoughts, these are often overwhelmed by instinctual responses. Thus, a ferret familiar spying on a band of orcs in the woods might lose its train of thought upon sighting a mouse. Certainly its communications to its master would be tinged with fear of the “big ones” it was spying on! The caster cannot see through the familiar’s eyes. \n&emsp;If separated from the caster, the familiar loses 1 hit point each day, and dies if reduced to 0 hit points. When the familiar is in physical contact with its wizard, it gains the wizard’s saving throws against special attacks. If a special attack would normally cause damage, the familiar suffers no damage if the saving throw is successful and half damage if the saving throw is failed. If the familiar dies, the wizard must successfully roll an immediate system shock check or die. Even if he survives this check, the wizard loses 1 point from his Constitution when the familiar dies. \n&emsp;The power of the conjuration is such that it can be attempted but once per year. When the wizard decides to find a familiar, he must load a brass brazier with charcoal. When this is burning well, he adds 1,000 gp worth of incense and herbs. The spell incantation is then begun and must be continued until the familiar comes or the casting time is finished. The DM secretly determines all results. Note that most familiars are not inherently magical, nor does a *dispel magic* spell send them away. \n&emsp;Deliberate mistreatment, failure to feed and care for the familiar, or continuous unreasonable demands have adverse effects on the familiar’s relationship with its master. Purposely arranging the death of one’s own familiar incurs great disfavor from certain powerful entities, with dire results.'

The eight hours immediately preceding the casting of the spell must be spent purifying the items and removing influences that would corrupt and blur their magical auras. If this period is interrupted, it must be begun again. When the spell is cast, each item must be handled in turn by the wizard. Any consequences of this handling fall fully upon the wizard and may end the spell, although the wizard is allowed any applicable saving throw. \n&emsp;The chance of learning a piece of information about an item is equal to 10% per level of the caster, to a maximum of 90%, rolled by the DM. Current chance is [[{{(10*[[@{level-wizard}]]),90}kl1}]]%. Any roll of 96–00 indicates a false reading (91–95 reveals nothing). Only one function of a multifunction item is discovered per handling (i.e., a 5th-level wizard could attempt to determine the nature of five different items, five different functions of a single item, or any combination of the two). If any attempt at reading fails, the caster cannot learn any more about that item until he advances a level. Note that some items, such as special magical tomes, cannot be identified with this spell. \n&emsp;The item never reveals its exact attack or damage bonuses, although the fact that it has few or many bonuses can be determined. If it has charges, only a general indication of the number of charges remaining is learned: powerful (81% – 100% of the total possible charges), strong (61% – 80%), moderate (41% – 60%), weak (6% – 40%), or faint (five charges or less). The faint result takes precedence, so a fully charged *ring of three wishes* always appears to be only faintly charged. \n&emsp;After casting the spell and determining what can be learned from it, the wizard loses 8 points of Constitution. He must rest for one hour to recover each point of Constitution. If the 8-point loss drops the spellcaster below a Constitution of 1, he falls unconscious. Consciousness is not regained until full Constitution is restored, which takes 24 hours (one point per three hours for an unconscious character). \n&emsp;The material components infusion must be drunk prior to spellcasting. If a *luckstone* is powdered and added to the infusion, the divination becomes much more potent: Exact bonuses or charges can be determined, and the functions of a multifunctional item can be learned from a single reading.

A finely sewn gown or robe of high-quality material (at least 50 gp value) is fashioned so as to contain numerous hand-sized pockets. One dozen is the minimum number. The *deeppockets* spell then enables these pockets to hold a total of 100 pounds (5 cubic feet in volume) as if it were only 10 pounds of weight. Furthermore, there are no discernible bulges where the special pockets are. At the time of casting, the caster can instead choose to have 10 pockets each holding 10 pounds (1⁄2 cubic foot volume each). If the robe or like garment is sewn with 100 or more pockets (200 gp minimum cost), 100 pockets can be created to contain one pound of weight and 1⁄6 cubic foot volume each. Each special pocket is actually an extradimensional holding space. \n&emsp;If the spell duration expires while there is material within the enchanted pockets, or if a successful *dispel magic* is cast upon the enchanted garment, all the material suddenly appears around the wearer and immediately falls to the ground. The caster can also cause all the pockets to empty with a single command.'

The message, which must be of 25 words or less, can be in any language known by the spellcaster, and can be delivered over a period of one turn. The mouth cannot speak magical spells or use command words. It does, however, move to the words articulated—if it is placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would actually move and appear to speak. Of course, the magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, door, or any other object, excluding intelligent members of the animal or vegetable kingdoms. \n&emsp;The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled, according to the command of the spellcaster. Some examples are to speak “to the first creature that touches you,” or “to the first creature that passes within 30 feet.” Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used, such as the following: “Speak only when a venerable female human carrying a sack of groat clusters sits crosslegged within 1 foot.” Such visual triggers can react to a character using the *disguise* ability. Command range is 5 yards per level of the wizard ([[5*[[@{level-wizard}]] ]] yards), so a 6th-level wizard can command the magic mouth to speak at a maximum encounter range of 30 yards (“Speak when a winged creature comes within 30 yards.”). The spell lasts until the speak command can be fulfilled; thus, the spell duration is variable. A magic mouth cannot distinguish invisible creatures, alignments, level, Hit Dice, or class, except by external garb. If desired, the effect can be keyed to a specific noise or spoken word.'

When the spell reaches its objective, it swirls and remains until the message is delivered. As with the *magic mouth* spell, no spells may be cast via the *whispering wind*.'

This means that melee attacks against the wizard automatically miss if initiative indicates they fall after he has blinked. \n&emsp;Each round the spell is in effect, the wizard rolls 2d8 to determine the timing of the blink—the result of the dice roll is used as the wizard’s initiative for that round. The wizard disappears and instantaneously reappears 10 feet distant from his previous position. (Direction is determined by a roll of 1d8: 1 = right ahead, 2 = right, 3 = right behind, 4 = behind, 5 = left behind, 6 = left, 7 = left ahead, 8 = ahead.) The caster cannot blink into a solid object; if such is indicated, reroll the direction. Movable objects of size and mass comparable to the caster are shoved aside when the caster blinks in. If blinking is impossible except into a  fixed, solid object, the caster is then trapped on the Ethereal Plane. \n&emsp;During each round that he blinks, the spellcaster can be attacked only by opponents who win initiative or by those who are able to strike both locations at once (for example, with a breath weapon, fireball, or similar wide-area attack forms). Opponents with multiple attacks, or those operating under haste or similar effects, can often strike early enough to have at least one attack against the caster. \n&emsp;If the spellcaster holds off his attack (if any) until after the blink, the 2d8 delay until the blink is added to his normal 1d10 initiative roll (thus, he probably attacks last in the round). The spellcaster can also try  to get his attack in before he blinks (he must announce his intent before rolling the 2d8 for blink timing and the 1d10 for initiative). In this case, the caster compares the two dice rolls, hoping that his initiative roll is lower than his blink roll (the two rolls are *not* added if he is trying to attack before he blinks). If so, he attacks according to his initiative roll, then blinks according to the blink roll. If his blink roll is lower than his  initiative roll, however, he blinks first and then attacks in whatever direction he’s facing (he must go through with his attack, even if he is facing in the wrong direction to affect anyone).'

Second, it disrupts the casting or use of these in the area of effect at the instant the dispel is cast. Third, it destroys magical potions (which are treated as 12th level for purposes of this spell). \n&emsp;Each effect or potion in the spell’s area is checked to determine if it is dispelled. The caster can always dispel his own magic; otherwise, the chance to dispel depends on the difference in level between the magical effect and the caster. The base chance is 50% (11 or higher on 1d20 to dispel). If the caster is of higher level than the creator of the effect to be dispelled, the difference is subtracted from the number needed on 1d20 to dispel (making it more likely that the dispel succeeds); if the caster is of lower level, the difference is *added* to the number needed on 1d20 to dispel (making it *less* likely that the dispel succeeds). A roll of 20 always succeeds and a roll of 1 always fails. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher, only a roll of 1 prevents the effect from being dispelled. \n&emsp;A *dispel magic* spell does not affect a specially enchanted item, such as a magical scroll, ring, wand, rod, staff, miscellaneous item, weapon, shield, or armor, unless it is cast directly upon the item. This renders the item nonoperational for 1d4 rounds. An item possessed and carried by a creature gains the creature’s saving throw against this effect; otherwise, it is automatically rendered nonoperational.

The fireball fills an area equal to its normal spherical volume (roughly 33,000 cubic feet—thirty-three 10-foot x 10-foot x 10-foot cubes). Besides causing damage to creatures, the fireball ignites all combustible materials within its burst radius, and the heat of the fireball melts soft metals such as gold, copper, silver, etc. Exposed items require saving throws vs. magical fire to determine if they are affected, but items in the possession of a creature that rolls a successful saving throw are unaffected by the fireball. \n&emsp;The wizard points his finger and speaks the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A streak flashes from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball (an early impact results in an early detonation). Creatures failing their saving throws each suffer full damage from the blast. Those who roll successful saving throws manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, each receiving half damage (the DM rolls the damage and each affected creature suffers either full damage or half damage [round fractions down], depending on whether the creature saved or not).'

The suggestion cannot require more than three turns to carry out. The suggestion could be to close the book and leave, or to forget the existence of the book, for example. A successful dispel magic spell will remove the illusionary script, but an unsuccessful attempt erases all of the writing. The hidden writings can be read by a combination of the *true seeing* spell and either the *read magic* or *comprehend languages* spell, as applicable.'

    'effect': 'Upon casting this spell, the wizard releases a powerful stroke of electrical energy that inflicts 1d6 points of damage per level of the spellcaster (maximum of 10d6) to each creature within its area of effect. A successful saving throw vs. spell reduces this damage to half (round fractions down). The bolt begins at a range and height decided by the caster and streaks outward in a direct line from the casting wizard (for example, if a 40-foot bolt was started at 180 feet from the wizard, the far end of the bolt would reach 220 feet (180 + 40). The lightning bolt may set fire to combustibles, sunder wooden doors, splinter up to a half-foot thickness of stone, and melt metals with a low melting point (lead, gold, copper, silver, bronze). Saving throws must be rolled for objects that withstand the full force of a stroke (see the *fireball* spell). If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it (i.e., the saving throw fails), the bolt continues. A bolt can breach 1 inch of wood or half an inch of stone per caster level, up to a maximum of 1 foot of wood or half a foot of stone. \n&emsp;The lightning bolt’s area of effect is chosen by the spellcaster: either a forked bolt 10 feet wide and 40 feet long or a single bolt 5 feet wide and 80 feet long. If a bolt cannot reach its full length, because of an unyielding barrier (such as a stone wall), the lightning bolt rebounds from the barrier toward its caster, ending only when it reaches its full length. \n&emsp;For example: An 80-foot-long stroke is begun at a range of 40 feet, but it hits a stone wall at 50 feet. The bolt travels 10 feet, hits the wall, and rebounds for 70 feet back toward its creator (who is only 50 feet from the wall, and so is caught in his own lightning bolt!). \n&emsp;The DM might allow reflecting bolts. When this type of lightning bolt strikes a solid surface, the bolt reflects from the surface at an angle equal to the angle of incidence (like light off a mirror). A creature crossed more than once by the bolt must roll a saving throw for every time it is crossed, but it still suffers either full damage (if one saving throw is missed) or half damage (if all saving throws are made).'

Note that this carries over into at least the following round. \n&emsp;B) The wizard discharges only one meteor per round. In addition to releasing the missile, the caster can perform other actions in the round, including spellcasting, melee, or device use.

Any damage to the caster is subtracted from the temporary hit points first. After one hour, any extra hit points above the caster’s normal total are lost. The creature originally losing hit points through this spell can regain them by magical or normal healing. Undead creatures are unaffected by this spell.'

(If in doubt, a saving throw vs. spell determines whether the subject maintains its grasp.) Normal insects cannot pass such a barrier. Loose materials, even cloth garments, fly upward when caught in a wind wall. Arrows and bolts are deflected upward and miss, while sling stones and other missiles under two pounds in weight receive a –4 penalty to a first shot and –2 penalties thereafter. Gases, most breath weapons, and creatures in gaseous form cannot pass this wall, although it is no barrier to noncorporeal creatures.'

The caster is subject only to magical or special attacks, including those by weapons of +1 or better, or by creatures otherwise able to affect those struck only by magical weapons. Undead of most sorts will ignore an individual in wraithform, believing him to be a wraith or spectre, though a lich or special undead may save vs. spell with a –4 penalty to recognize the spell. \n&emsp;The wizard can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, with all he wears or holds in his hands, as long as the spell persists. Note, however, that the caster cannot fly without additional magic. No form of attack is possible when in wraithform, except against creatures that exist on the Ethereal Plane, where all attacks (both ways) are normal. A successful *dispel magic* spell forces the wizard in wraithform back to normal form. The spellcaster can end the spell with a single word.'

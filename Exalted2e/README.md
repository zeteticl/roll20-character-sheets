## _Exalted, Second Edition_ Character Sheet

Character sheet for _Exalted, Second Edition_ by White Wolf Publishing.

### NOTE

`exalted2e.css` and `exalted2e.html` **must** be saved with Unicode encoding. Using Unicode character codes does not currently work with the character sheet system, so the characters themselves must be used. Saving the file as ANSI, etc. will break the appearance of the character sheet.


### To Do
* Add Ability sections for Lunars, Abyssals, Infernals and Sidereals
* Fix the stat-tracking radio-inputs so that stats are truly zeroed with the first radio-button, in the way every other Wolrd of Darkness sheet works
* Fix roll buttons in Combat section
* Add roll buttons for stats in general
* Refactor code: move roll template to the end, place html sections in order they appear on sheet, borrow more code from later WoD sheets

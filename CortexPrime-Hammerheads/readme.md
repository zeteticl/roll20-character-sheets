##Stress

I have been using API macro's to adjust Stress values. But these are simply Attributes (PhysicalStress, MentalStress, SocialStress).

You can add these to the Attributes and Abilities tab manually, and assign values ranging from 2 to show the character has no stress - 4,6,8,10 or 12 corresponding to the dice value, or a value of 14 indicates the character has been stressed out.

###Diceroller

Using the 'Dice Pool Builder' button will ask the player which traits to include and roll in a dice pool. The output to the chat panel will also indicate if the character is shaken or stricken. 

Any feedback, or requests - I'm happy to hear.

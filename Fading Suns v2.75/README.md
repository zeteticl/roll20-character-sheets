# TODO
- updated selected_skill_value when a non-repeating skill value changes (done already for repeating creative/lore skills)
- Allow choice b/w public vs GM roll
- Body Modifications (= Cyber) section
- Initiative roll query - translations
- Initiative roll query - parse list of Combat Styles known by the character
- Vitality critical levels (-2 to -10) to affect goal numbers
- Combo-boxes for Characteristic & Skills, leading to auto-determination of goal numbers for Combat actions, Psi powers, Theurgy rituals, etc..
- Weapons & armors property checkboxes (Shock, Laser, Plasma, etc..) & replace d6rolls with proper damage/armor rolls showing shield-piercing vs normal damage, etc.
- Support for Symbiot characters

# Nice-to-have
- Infoboxes, e.g. how to compute init, wyrd, vita...
- Fading Suns Logo

## Translation Notes

Some of the translation tag name have suffixes to indicate where they are used. If a particular tag is used in several places, I haven't added any suffixes.

- `-rt` : Used in a roll template. Example: "defend-rt"
- `-m` : Used in a roll button macros or similar. Example: "weakness-m"

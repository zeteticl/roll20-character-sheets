# Runequest Glorantha Character Sheet

At the top of each version of the sheet is a settings cog if this is clicked there are check  boxes to select which version of the sheet to display.  This will allow for selection of the sheet displayed if for some reason this settings in the Game Details fails.

## If you have a pre-existing Quick Start character from before the full sheet was added the only things that will transfer are characterisitcs.
~~## If you open the full release version of the sheet you must allow it to finish adding skills before you close it.  If you do not the skills will be added again.~~

## If the default in game settings is set to a QS sheet and  you then change it to a full sheet in the configuration you will have to close the sheet and open it again for the skills to be added.


## Quick Start

This is for the Qucik Start only the category modifiers are not calculated and is intended only for one shots to demo the new system

One thing to note is the way the damage per location works.  Instead of just knocking  points down as damage is taken there is a damage box so you can put in wounds as they are taken so that you can apply first aid separately.  So if you take a 2 wound and then a 4 point the damage box  should look like 2+4. Make sure there is no trailing + signs, so don't have it look like 3+5+ .  There is a separate box in the hit point section for damage to total hit points such as bleeding and poison. 

Make sure the STR and DEX minimums are entered for weapons as you could end up with large penalties to attack if you do not.

In the animals section make sure you include the damage bonus for the animals 1d6+3d6.  A default bonus is calculated in the stats section but the damage bonus can vary depening on the weapon.  It could be full no damage bonus/full damage bonus/half damge or even just damage bonus.

Make sure you put the full mp cost for a variable spell in the mp column so that Free INT can be calculated.
 
## Full Release

One thing to note is the way the damage per location works.  Instead of just knocking  points down as damage is taken there is a damage box so you can put in wounds as they are taken so that you can apply first aid separately.  So if you take a 2 wound and then a 4 point the damage box  should look like 2+4. Make sure there is no trailing + signs, so don't have it look like 3+5+ .  There is a separate box in the hit point section for damage to total hit points such as bleeding and poison. 

Click on a rune to make a roll for that rune.

In the weapon section * indicates to use the mounts damage bonus and not the players

Default in the weapon section indicates that you are using a skill from the same category e.g. using Broadsword skill with a short sword.  It will halve the skill as per the rules.

To remove the experience checkbox from a skill add a - at the start of the name e.g. -Animal Lore. To add the experience checkbox  add a + to the start of a skill name e.g. +Animal Lore

STR and DEX minimums are not currently supported this maybe added in a future release.

## Version 04.03.2019

Tweaked CSS so skill names can be read when modifying repeating sections

Added fields for coinage on the 2nd tab.  Currently this does not effect encumbrance.

I added a bunch of new hit locations including all the location tables  at the start of the bestiary. 

Added fields for individual weapons skill modifiers or occasions such as Bladesharp cast.



I also added checkboxes with the heading Spells Cast for Vigor, Strength  and Glamour they handle all the fudges listed under the spells,such as skill category  increases, damage die steps and max enc.So don't add the stat bonuses in the mod fields of the characteristics.The bonuses are automatically added to stat rolls. A message appears under the stats  reminding you to add the bonus when doing resistance table rolls.  There is probably better way of doing this but it would mean changing a lot of sheetworkers and/or adding a whole new column of mod fields


## Version 17.03.2019
